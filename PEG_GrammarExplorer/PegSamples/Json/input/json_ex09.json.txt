happen every day but it does happen more frequently than i\u0027d like. and in each and every case the person who berates me is fat. i don\u0027t know why this is. do fat people inherently feel the need to point out my shortcomings? do they just hate me? i don\u0027t know. so the warning is there for you, read no further if you may be offended by my calling someone fat. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003elike each and every occurrence in my life it starts with - i was minding my own. and i was. i go to considerable pains to avoid shopping at our local jumbo supermarket chains. i\u0027ve always had a preference for trader joe\u0027s or the occasional indie shop but a couple years back workers at the big chains went on strike. i opted to not cross their picket lines and i\u0027ve never been back.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ewell, almost never. on an ugly, santa ana wind infested sunday afternoon i was tired and needed a couple items and the jumbo was so easy and on the way home, i bit the bullet and went in. i managed the find the items i was looking for without much trouble and got into line. there were two shoppers ahead of me, both with items on the conveyer belt and shortly after arriving, someone was behind me in line. i walked forward when there was room and began to place my items on the conveyor when the woman behind me said something so i turned around and drank in her enormitude and knew it was going downhill from there. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshe: \u0022you\u0027re doing it wrong\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eme: \u0022what?\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshe: \u0022that\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ei looked where she pointed, in the general direction of my groin, and looked back in what must have appeared as simian incomprehensive (or maybe that puppy thing with the turned head). \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshe: \u0022you can\u0027t do it like that. the cart has to be in front of you\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003esure enough, i was in fact standing in front of my cart, reaching to my left (as i faced the register) to pick my items up. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshe: \u0022i can\u0027t put my stuff up there with your cart in the way\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ehere is where i should have left well enough alone. i know that now, ok? so no need to point it out. instead, i said something like..\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eme: \u0022irrespective of where i\u0027m standing in relation to the cart we (the cart and i) occupy the same amount of space\u0022 i did NOT add \u0022which is roughly half of the space you occupy on your own\u0022.. see? i DO self-censor.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eshe: \u0022no. that\u0027s wrong\u0022\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003enow i have a feeling this last comment was calculated to get me to do what she wanted. and it did. to demonstrate i switched places with the cart and yep, same amount of space. undeterred she reached across me, practically bent over at the waist to show that NOW she could reach the belt. she went on to explain that i \u0022need to learn the rules\u0022 and \u0022do it right.\u0022 i asked her simply \u0022please stop talking to me\u0022 and with one more \u0022gladly!\u0022, she did.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003ethis is at least the third time i\u0027ve been yelled at by other customers in big chain stores by fat people. so now it\u0027s my stock reply when asked why i don\u0027t visit wal-mart, k-mart, ralphs, or costco. \u0022the fat people there HATE me!\u0022"},"link":[{"rel":"alternate","type":"text/html","href":"http://blogname.blogspot.com/2007/11/its-just-way.html","title":"it\u0027s just the
